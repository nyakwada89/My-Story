    <p>
      I am currently a student and enjoy learning different skills that I can
      add to my current skill set. I hope to put all I learn to good use or even
      launch my career.<br />
      I have found coding to be interesting and I am excited for beginning this
      journey. In order to reach me or otherwise you can find me on <strong><a target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/faith-nyakwada-53a02b83/">LinkedIn</a></strong>.
